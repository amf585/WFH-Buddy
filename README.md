# WFH Buddy
 
This is a simple tool I created to share some key status items with my wife while I am working from home. 

Things like:
* If I am in a meeting
* When I need focus time
* What my mood is
* Etc.

I wanted to work with Auth0, NextJS, and WebSockets to gain more knowledge about these technologies so I used those 3 as the foundation for this app
